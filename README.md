# IncreaseYourTrainingData
*This is a collaborative project by Falk Heuer, Viviane Kakerbeck, Johannes Schrumpf and Justine Winkler.*

Increase the amount of image training data for your network training by finding more images of the same object/scene online. This is done by using
google image reverse search to extract the content in an image and then by crawling google images (and potentially other sources) for similar images.
