# IncreaseYourTrainingData
*This is a collaborative project by Falk Heuer, Viviane Kakerbeck, Johannes Schrumpf and Justine Winkler.*

Increase the amount of image training data for your network training by finding more images of the same object/scene online. This is done by using
google image reverse search to extract the content in an image and then by crawling google images (and potentially other sources) for similar images.

This was written as a one day project and intended as a help for anybody who needs a lot of image data. If there are any errors or problems
just contact us. We would love to make this code as usefriendly as possible.
